# aws-console
A simple CLI tool to open the AWS management console from the command line without the need for an AWS console username and password. It creates a temporary session and sign-in token to access the AWS console. Signing in to the console with the generated URL creates a session that is valid for 12 hours.

### Contributing
Unfortunately, I am not accepting any contributions or PRs (Pull Requests) at the moment. The package still WIP, And until I open the project for contribution, add a code of conduct, I'd recommenced requesting new features via the [issues section](https://github.com/minayousseif/aws-console/issues).
